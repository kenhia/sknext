## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality & Standards

All code produced MUST meet the following non-negotiable quality standards:

- **Maintainability**: Code must be clear, well-documented, and follow consistent patterns
- **Modularity**: Functionality must be broken into focused, reusable components
- **Documentation**: Every public interface must have clear docstrings explaining purpose, parameters, and return values
- **Style Compliance**: Code must pass all configured linting and formatting checks before commit
- **Type Safety**: When applicable, use type hints/annotations to improve code clarity and catch errors early

**Rationale**: Quality standards prevent technical debt accumulation and ensure the codebase remains accessible to all team members, reducing onboarding time and maintenance costs.

### II. Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Testing is **NON-NEGOTIABLE** and follows strict TDD principles:

- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Write tests first → Watch them fail → Implement feature → Pass tests → Refactor
- **Test Coverage**: All new code paths must have corresponding tests
- **Test Types Required**:
  - **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions/methods in isolation
  - **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions and contracts
  - **Contract Tests**: Verify API/interface boundaries match specifications
- **Pre-Commit Gate**: All tests must pass before code can be committed
- **Independent Stories**: Each user story must be independently testable as a deliverable MVP increment

**Rationale**: TDD catches bugs early, ensures requirements are met, provides living documentation, and enables confident refactoring. Tests written after implementation often miss edge cases and don't validate actual requirements.

### III. User Experience Consistency

User-facing features must deliver consistent, predictable experiences:

- **Interface Stability**: Public APIs, CLI interfaces, and UX patterns must remain consistent within major versions
- **Error Messages**: Provide clear, actionable error messages that guide users toward resolution
- **Documentation Alignment**: User-facing docs, help text, and examples must match actual behavior
- **Accessibility**: Interfaces must be usable by diverse users (consider screen readers, keyboard navigation, etc.)
- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Provide clear progress indicators for long-running operations

**Rationale**: Consistency reduces cognitive load, accelerates user adoption, and minimizes support burden. Users trust systems that behave predictably.

### IV. Performance & Optimization

Performance characteristics must be defined, measured, and maintained:

- **Requirements Definition**: Each feature must specify performance targets (response times, throughput, resource usage)
- **Measurement**: Performance-critical paths must include instrumentation and monitoring
- **Regression Prevention**: Performance tests must be part of CI pipeline for critical paths
- **Resource Efficiency**: Code must avoid unnecessary allocations, loops, and I/O operations
- **Scalability Awareness**: Design decisions must consider how features scale with increased load/data

**Rationale**: Performance is a feature. Defining requirements upfront prevents costly rewrites and ensures user satisfaction at scale.

### V. Pre-Commit Validation (MANDATORY)

**This principle is NON-NEGOTIABLE for all commits affecting source code or dependencies.**

Before committing ANY changes that include modifications to:
- Source code files (language-specific, e.g., `.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.rs`, `.swift`, `.kt`, etc.)
- Dependency lock files (e.g., `uv.lock`, `package-lock.json`, `Cargo.lock`, `Podfile.lock`, etc.)
- Dependency configuration files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `Podfile`, etc.)
- Build configuration files (e.g., `tsconfig.json`, `webpack.config.js`, `build.gradle`, etc.)

You MUST run the complete pre-commit workflow:

1. **Code Formatting**: Run the project's formatter (technology-specific)
2. **Code Linting**: Run the project's linter with auto-fix (technology-specific)
3. **Test Suite**: Run all unit tests

**All three steps MUST complete successfully with zero errors before the commit is allowed.** If any step fails, fix the errors and rerun ALL three steps from the beginning, as fixing one issue (e.g., a test failure) can introduce new formatting or linting errors.

**Rationale**: Source code and dependency changes have the highest risk of introducing bugs, breaking builds, or causing CI failures. Mandatory pre-commit validation catches issues immediately, prevents broken code from entering the repository, maintains code quality standards, and reduces the cost of fixing problems. Dependency changes can alter runtime behavior and must be validated against the full test suite.

**Enforcement**: 
- CI/CD pipelines MUST reject commits that do not meet these standards
- Git hooks SHOULD be configured to enforce this workflow locally
- Code review processes MUST verify pre-commit validation was performed

**Exemptions**: Only documentation-only commits (e.g., README, markdown files with no code blocks) are exempt from this requirement.

## Technology Stack Requirements

The specific technology stack will be determined per feature/specification. When a technology stack is chosen, the following MUST be defined:

### Dependency & Environment Management

- **Tool**: Specify the dependency manager (e.g., `uv` for Python, `npm/yarn` for JavaScript, `cargo` for Rust)
- **Environment**: Specify environment management approach (e.g., virtual environments, containers)

### Code Quality Tooling

- **Formatter**: Specify the code formatter (e.g., `ruff format`, `prettier`, `rustfmt`)
- **Linter**: Specify the linter (e.g., `ruff check`, `eslint`, `clippy`)
- **Configuration**: Project must include appropriate configuration files with explicit rule definitions

### Testing Framework

- **Test Runner**: Specify the test framework (e.g., `pytest`, `jest`, `cargo test`)
- **Test Organization**: Define how unit, integration, and contract tests are organized

**Pre-Commit Workflow Template**:

```bash
# Example for Python with uv/ruff/pytest:
uv run ruff format .
uv run ruff check --fix .
uv run pytest

# Example for JavaScript/TypeScript:
npm run format
npm run lint -- --fix
npm test

# Example for Rust:
cargo fmt
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo test
```

All commands MUST pass before committing.

## Development Workflow

### Phase Completion Gates

Before completing any development phase (research, design, implementation):

1. **Alignment Check**: Verify all code, specs, documentation, and tests remain consistent
2. **Cross-Reference Validation**: Ensure changes are reflected across all affected artifacts
3. **Constitution Compliance**: Confirm all principles are satisfied

### Version Control Discipline

- **Commit Frequency**: Commit to version control before starting each new phase or major work block
- **Commit Messages**: Use conventional commit format (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`)

**Note**: Pre-commit validation requirements are specified in Principle V above.

### Ad-Hoc Changes & Consistency

When making ad-hoc changes outside the standard workflow (e.g., CLI parameter adjustments):

1. **Pause Before Proceeding**: Offer to analyze the change for consistency impact
2. **Cross-Artifact Check**: Verify specs, docs, tests, and code all reflect the change
3. **Document Decision**: Update relevant documentation to match the new behavior

**Rationale**: Ad-hoc changes are high-risk for introducing inconsistencies. Systematic verification prevents specification drift and documentation rot.

## Governance

### Authority

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. All pull requests, code reviews, and planning documents must verify compliance with these principles.

### Amendment Process

1. **Proposal**: Document the proposed change and rationale
2. **Impact Analysis**: Identify affected templates, specs, and code
3. **Migration Plan**: Define steps to bring existing work into compliance
4. **Approval**: Secure stakeholder approval before implementation
5. **Version Update**: Increment constitution version according to semantic versioning

### Versioning Policy

- **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Backward-incompatible principle removals or redefinitions
- **MINOR** (x.Y.0): New principles added or existing principles materially expanded
- **PATCH** (x.y.Z): Clarifications, wording improvements, typo fixes

### Compliance Review

- Constitution compliance must be verified at spec, plan, and implementation phases
- Violations must be justified in writing if they cannot be resolved
- Patterns of non-compliance trigger constitution review for practical feasibility

### Runtime Guidance

For day-to-day development guidance incorporating these principles, refer to `.specify/templates/agent-file-template.md` (auto-generated from feature plans and active technologies).
